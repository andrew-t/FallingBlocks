test:
* game
* inputListener
* renderer
* transformMatrix
* transformMatrixDefinitionFactory
* transformMatrixFactory
* transformVector
* keyboardInputSource

write:
* renderer

* consider making game state an object instead of a wrapper
    it can do removeCompleteRows and landTetrimino for itself
    and also canMoveObjectInDirection and canRotateObjectInDirection
    (all currently in engine)
* show score
* speed up every 10 lines
* implement pause/unpause

why does rotating a square around (0.5, 0.5) do weird things?
should be able to do this, or (more likely) specify centre as null and not rotate
