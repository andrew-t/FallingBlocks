test:
* game
* inputListener
* renderer
* transformMatrix
* transformMatrixDefinitionFactory
* transformMatrixFactory
* transformVector
* keyboardInputSource

write:
* renderer

* show score
* speed up every 10 lines
* implement pause/unpause
* change logic so blocks can use whole playing area but game is over when new block can't spawn
